<h1><b>My Terrace Garden Blog</b></h1>

<p>
    <b>Welcome to my terrace garden!</b> I have always dreamed of having a small green space at home where I could relax, 
    enjoy the fresh air, and watch plants grow. Our terrace gave me the perfect opportunity to start my garden. 
    Initially, I planted only a few plants, but over time, it has transformed into a beautiful garden filled with 
    a variety of plants. Every plant has its own charm, and taking care of them has been a wonderful learning experience.

    The Mother of Thousands is a fascinating succulent. Tiny baby plants grow along the edges of its leaves, 
    and seeing them appear is always exciting. This plant multiplies quickly, giving the terrace a lush and green look. 
    It is very easy to care for and does not require frequent watering. I love watching the small plantlets grow 
    into new plants over time, making the garden lively and dynamic.

    in shades of purple, pink, and white. It grows well in pots and sunny areas of the terrace. 
    The flowers last a long time and are often used for decoration and dried flower arrangements. 
    This plant adds bright colors to the garden and attracts butterflies, making the terrace lively and cheerful.

    Sunflowers are bright, cheerful, and full of energy. Their tall stems and vibrant yellow petals instantly uplift the terrace. 
    They require plenty of sunlight, and taking care of them has taught me patience and attention. 
    I love seeing them bloom in the morning, swaying gently in the breeze. They attract bees and butterflies, 
    adding even more life to the garden. Every sunflower feels like a little sun that brings happiness to my day.
